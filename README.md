# Giphy

#Giphy is a small project I had made that utilizes javascript, jquery, and ajax 'GET' request.

#Making ajax call to the Giphy API, I am able to render gif images of different aniamls.

#This program has the capability of rendering images that fit a pg rating as described by Giphy. Another feature is that it allows the user to add any animal they choose.

#In the picture below you will see that I have added a wolf to my list.
